## Wordle Game Implementation with React.js

This game is designed in a way that you have to guess a 5-word number with just 6 chances; If you
could guess the word before loosing your chances, you win and if not, you loose and in both scenarios,
the game will be reset.

There is a customized keyboard in the game that if you click on letters that are not in the
target word, they will be disable; Also when you click the letters that are in the word but in a wrong
place, they will be yellow in the word placeholder and if it's in the correct place, it will be green and
also the key on keyboard will change to green, too.
